# Current Bemnet Dejene Portfolio
This app is an application/evaluation of my progress, presenting my most recent projects and skills for possible future work, whether it be freelancing or full time work. The project itself is a single page application (SPA), using transitions and filters to create focus on important information and overall readibility. The app itself was prototyped using Figma for wiring framing, as well as exporting custom SVGs that I created myself for enhancing styling. Prototyping was done for the 3 major devices: desktop, tablet and mobile. App is also fully responsive to all devices.


## Technologies Used
- React
- JS
- Figma
- Semantic HTML
- CSS/Sass



## What I Learned
- Figma app prototyping/wireframing
- exporting of figma SVGs/element ids for possible animations
- Better techniques for responsive web design of absolutely positioned elements 

## How I would Improve 
- Create actual custom SVG animations to make a more enhanced user experience
- Use meta tags/React Helmets for better SEO to expand my reach globally
