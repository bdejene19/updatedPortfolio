           <p>In order to give your all into a project, your mind and body need to be 100% focused, making a work-life balance extremely important to me. By nature, I am an easy going person who's always smiling and love to express my creative thinking through code, piano, guitar and even freestyling rapping ðŸŽ¶ (no sound cloud, haha).</p>
           <p>The reason I fell in love with code was that it enabled my creative and logistic halves of myself, work in tandem to create something truly amazing.</p>
